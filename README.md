Attempt 1
• In attempt 1 as the Center of Mass(COM) moves from 0 to center of the step length (0.75/2)
  we move on single support phase for right leg.
• At the center the body is on the double support phase
• And as the COM moves from center(0.75/2) to the full step length(0.75) we are on single
  support phase for left leg.

Attempt 2
• In attempt 2 as the Center of Mass(COM) moves from 0 to center of the step length (0.75/2)
  we move on the single support phase for right leg
• At the center the body is on double support phase.
• As COM moves from 0.75/2 to (0.75/2 + 0.75/4) we move on the double support phase
• And as the COM moves from (0.75/2 + 0.75/4) to 0.75 we move on the single support phase
  of left leg.
